# MongoDB Cloud API Client

This is a Ruby client and a command-line tool for the [MongoDB Atlas API
](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/). Other Cloud APIs may be added in the
future based on demand.

This tool is an alternative to [mongocli](https://github.com/mongodb/mongocli).
It was started to address the following goals:

- Support for actions that mongocli did not implement (such as Atlas
organization management).
- Flatter, easier to use command line argument/option structure.
- A Ruby API client consumable by other libraries/programs.
